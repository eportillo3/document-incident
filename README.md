<h1>Document an incident with an incident handler's journal</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, you will review the details of a security incident and document the incident using your incident handler's journal. Previously, you learned about the importance of documentation in the incident response process. You've also learned how an incident handler's journal is used to record information about security incidents as they are handled. 

<h2>Scenario</h2>

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

<h2>Incident handler's journal</h2>

<h3>Date: 10/14/24</h3>
<h3>Entry: 1</h3>

<h3>Description:</h3>

This journal entry describes a ransomware attack on a small U.S. health care clinic that occurred on a Tuesday morning. Employees reported being unable to access essential files, including medical records, due to the encryption of the clinic's data by an organized group of hackers. The attackers demanded a ransom in exchange for the decryption key, severely disrupting business operations. The breach was caused by phishing emails that tricked employees into downloading malware, which allowed the attackers to deploy ransomware, encrypting the clinic's critical files and forcing the clinic to seek outside help.

<h3>Tool(s) used:</h3>

None.

<h3>The 5 W's</h3>

Capture the 5 W's of an incident.

- Who caused the incident?
  
  An organized group of unethical hackers, known for targeting healthcare and transportation industries, caused the incident.

- What happened?
  
  The clinic experienced a ransomware attack. Phishing emails with malicious attachments were sent to employees, leading to   the installation of malware and encryption of critical files, including patient records. The hackers demanded a ransom for the decryption key, which caused business operations to shut down.

- When did the incident occur?

  The incident occurred on a Tuesday morning, around 9:00 a.m.

- Where did the incident happen?

  The incident happened at a small U.S. health care clinic that specializes in primary-care services.

- Why did the incident happen?

  The incident happened because the attackers exploited phishing emails, which employees mistakenly opened, leading to the installation of malware. This allowed the hackers to deploy ransomware and encrypt critical files, disrupting operations.

<h3>Additional notes</h3>

<h4>Additional Thoughts:</h4>
Lack of Preparedness: It’s unclear if the clinic had any form of cybersecurity awareness training for employees, which could have helped prevent phishing attacks. Awareness and training are key defenses against social engineering attacks like phishing.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: If the clinic had proper data backups in place, they may have been able to restore their systems without paying the ransom. The absence of this detail suggests that backups either weren’t available or were compromised.

<h4>Questions:</h4>
Were there any backups available, and if so, were they compromised by the attackers?
How long did it take for the clinic to detect the phishing emails?
Were any third-party services involved in resolving the incident (e.g., cybersecurity firms, law enforcement)?
Was there any evidence of patient data being exfiltrated, suggesting a potential data breach in addition to the ransomware?
Did the clinic pay the ransom, or were they able to recover using other methods?

Incident Response Plan: There’s no mention of an incident response plan. Having a well-documented response plan could have helped the clinic minimize downtime and better coordinate their efforts in addressing the attack.

<h4>Findings:</h4>
Phishing Remains a Key Attack Vector: Phishing was the root cause of the breach, a common tactic used in cyberattacks. This highlights the importance of email security measures and employee training.

Healthcare Industry Vulnerability: This incident underscores how healthcare organizations, even small clinics, are prime targets for cybercriminals because of their reliance on sensitive patient data and the need for continuous operations.

Recovery and Reporting Delays: The company had to shut down its systems and contact multiple organizations for help, which could have been streamlined if they had a cybersecurity team or an established process for immediate response.
